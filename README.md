This repository contains a small, production-style finite state machine (FSM)
library written in ISO C. The project focuses on correctness, explicit error
handling, and ease of review rather than feature completeness.

Steps to build FSM library on Linux machine:

    1. Open terminal and navigate to cloned repository.
    2. Execute command "make all".
    3. Execute command "make example"
    4. Execute command "make test"

Object files can be found in "obj" directory and libfsm.a can be found in "lib" directory.

Test and example executables can be found in "test" and "example" directories respectively.
